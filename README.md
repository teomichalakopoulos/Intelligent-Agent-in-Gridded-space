# Intelligent-Agent-in-Gridded-space
Design and implementation of an intelligent agent in a grid-based environment using AgentSpeak and Java, modeling the problem as a state-space search with rewards.

This build was implemented using Gradle. In this repo gradle is not set up as it should. The setup will be done in the future. However the src files are correct.

The contributors of the project are: Θεόδωρος Μιχαλακόπουλος and Παναγιώτης Γαλάνης.
